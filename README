Thank you to pushrax for the node-rcon package

All you need is NodeJS & NPM

Once that is set up:

Install node-rcon via command 'npm install rcon'

(If Linux) Install screen via command 'apt/yum install screen'

Save this script as 'autorestart.js'

Then run this script after configuring it via command 'node autorestart.js' (If Linux 'screen node autostart.js')

Config is towards the top of the file. 

Be sure your server application itself is on a loop so that when the server closes it starts itself back up.
