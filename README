Thank you to pushrax for the node-rcon package
All you need is NodeJS & NPM

Install node-rcon via command 'npm install rcon'

Save this script as 'autorestart.js'

Then run this script after configuring it via command 'node autorestart.js'

Config is towards the top of the file. 

Be sure your server application itself is on a loop so that when the server closes it starts itself back up.
